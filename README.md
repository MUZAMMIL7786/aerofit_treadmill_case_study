# aerofit_treadmill_case_study
Aerofit is a leading brand of treadmills in India. The company has been in business for over 30 years, and it has a strong reputation for quality and reliability. However, Aerofit is facing some challenges in the current market.  One of the biggest challenges that Aerofit faces is competition.

Here are some of the specific business problems that Aerofit is facing:

- Declining sales: Aerofit's sales have been declining in recent years. This is due to a number of factors, including competition, changing customer expectations, and regulatory challenges.
- Low margins: Aerofit's margins are low. This is because the company is facing price pressure from competitors, and it is also spending a lot of money on research and development.
- High costs: Aerofit's costs are high. This is because the company is manufacturing its treadmills in India, where labor costs are relatively high.

## Insights: The insights that I derived from my analysis of the Aerofit treadmill business problem are as follows:

- The fitness equipment market is becoming increasingly competitive, and Aerofit will need to continue to innovate in order to stay ahead of the competition.
- Customers are becoming more demanding, and Aerofit will need to meet these demands in order to retain customers.
- The regulatory environment for fitness equipment is changing, and Aerofit will need to stay up-to-date on these changes in order to avoid compliance issues.


## Recommendations: Based on my insights, I recommend that Delhivery focus on the following areas:

- Men spent more money than women, Hence Focus more on Men products
- Product_Category - 1, 5, 8, & 11 have highest purchasing frequency. it means these are the
products in these categories are liked more by customers. Company can focus on selling more
of these products or selling more of the products which are purchased less.
- Unmarried customers spend more money than married customers, So walmart should focus
on acquisition of Unmarried customers.
- Customers in the age 18-45 spend more money than the others, So company should focus on
acquisition of customers who are in the age 18-45
- Male customers living in City_Category C spend more money than other male customers
living in B or C, Selling more products in the City_Category C will help the company
increase the revenue.
