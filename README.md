# aerofit_treadmill_case_study
Aerofit is a leading brand of treadmills in India. The company has been in business for over 30 years, and it has a strong reputation for quality and reliability. However, Aerofit is facing some challenges in the current market.  One of the biggest challenges that Aerofit faces is competition.

Here are some of the specific business problems that Aerofit is facing:

- Declining sales: Aerofit's sales have been declining in recent years. This is due to a number of factors, including competition, changing customer expectations, and regulatory challenges.
- Low margins: Aerofit's margins are low. This is because the company is facing price pressure from competitors, and it is also spending a lot of money on research and development.
- High costs: Aerofit's costs are high. This is because the company is manufacturing its treadmills in India, where labor costs are relatively high.
